## Introduction
In this analysis, we are examining whether there is a relationship between a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per person and the percentage of its population using the internet. Our hypothesis was that wealthier countries are more likely to have the technological accessibility needed to support widespread internet. This was supported by outside evidence from an author at Pew Research @Author_2014. We got the data regarding internet usage from Gapminder @Gapminder, and we got our data on income from World Bank @World_Bank_Open_Data.

## Data Cleaning

Before the analysis, we converted any GDP per Capita values into full numeric values. For example, income values like "31.7k" were converted to "31700" to allow for numerical analysis. We applied this conversion to all years for each country, then reshaped the table so that each row corresponds to a single country-year observation. We performed a similar conversion for the internet usage percentages before merging the two sources together.

```{r}
# Load in all necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
```

```{r}
# Read in the csv files
income_original <- read_csv("income_per_person_long_series.csv")
internet_original <- read_csv("internet_users.csv")
```

```{r}
# Cleaning Income data
# Function to convert 'k' values (e.g., "1.1k") to numeric
convert_k_to_num <- function(x) {
  x <- as.character(x)
  ifelse(
    str_detect(x, "k"),
    as.numeric(str_remove(x, "k")) * 1000,
    as.numeric(x)
  )
}

# Apply conversion to all columns except 'country'
income_clean <- income_original |>
  mutate(across(-country, 
                convert_k_to_num)) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "income") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r}
# Cleaning Internet Data
internet_clean <- internet_original |>
  mutate(across(-country, 
                convert_k_to_num)) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "internet_users") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r}
# Join the Datasets
combined_data <- income_clean |>
  inner_join(internet_clean, 
             by = c("country", 
                    "year"))
```

## Modeling the Relationship between Average Internet Usage and GDP per Capita

**Data Visualization**

```{r}
# Code for 2.1 Part 1
avg_data <- combined_data |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(avg_income = mean(income, 
                              na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_internet_users = mean(internet_users, 
                                      na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
ggplot(avg_data, 
       aes(x = avg_income, 
           y = avg_internet_users)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,
             color = "darkblue", 
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Average Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "Average GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Average Internet Usage (%)",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The above plot shows each country’s average GDP per Capita on the x‐axis and its average Internet usage rate on the y‐axis (across all available years). From this plot we can see a positive trend that countries with higher average income also tend to have greater internet usage.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Code for 2.1 Part 2
animated_plot <- ggplot(combined_data, 
                        aes(x = income, 
                            y = internet_users)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             color = "red", 
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Internet Usage (%)",
       title = "Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita: {round(frame_time)}", 
       subtitle = "Each point is one country in a given year",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal() +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

# 2) Render as a GIF, saved it to an object to try to fix rendering issues
animated_obj <- animate(animated_plot, 
                        fps = 2, 
                        duration = 10,
                        width = 600, 
                        height = 450,
                        renderer = gifski_renderer())

anim_save("income_vs_internet.gif", 
          animation = animated_obj)
```

![](income_vs_internet.gif)

The animated plot here shows the change over time for all countries in within the dataset. Using the graph we can infer that over time, the internet usage increases alongside the GDP per Capita.

**Linear Regression**

For the linear regression, we chose to summarize our data by getting each country’s average GDP per capita and internet usage rate across all available years. This allows us to represent every country with a single point on the graph, thus enabling a linear regression line.

```{r}
# Code for 2.2
# Scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(avg_data, 
       aes(x = avg_income, 
           y = avg_internet_users)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", 
             alpha = 0.7,
             size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "Average GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Average Internet Usage (%)",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Fit linear regression model
model <- lm(avg_internet_users ~ avg_income, 
            data = avg_data)

# Tidy and display coefficients
tidy(model) |>
  mutate(Term = case_when(term == "(Intercept)"  ~ "Intercept",
                          term == "avg_income"   ~ "Avg Income (USD) - Slope"),
         Estimate = round(estimate, 3),
         `Std. Error` = round(std.error, 3),
         `t‐value` = round(statistic, 3),
         `p‐value` = formatC(p.value, 
                             format = "e", 
                             digits = 2)) |>
  select(Term, 
         Estimate, 
         `Std. Error`, 
         `t‐value`, 
         `p‐value`) |>
  kable(caption = "Linear Regression Coefficients: Internet Usage ~ GDP per Capita",
        col.names = c("Term", 
                      "Estimate", 
                      "Std. Error", 
                      "t‐value", 
                      "p‐value"),
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r"))
```

From our linear regression model, we can see that $$
\widehat{\text{Internet}} \;=\; 12.683 \;+\; 0.001 \times \text{Income}.
$$\
The intercept (12.683) represents a baseline internet usage rate when income = 0, and the slope (0.001) indicates that a \$1 increase in GDP per Capita corresponds to a 0.001 percentage‐point increase in internet usage.

**Model Fit**

```{r}
# Code for 2.3
# Extract vectors
y_vec <- avg_data$avg_internet_users
y_hat_vec <- fitted(model)
resid_vec <- residuals(model)

# Compute variances
var_response <- var(y_vec,
                    na.rm = TRUE)
var_fitted <- var(y_hat_vec,
                  na.rm = TRUE)
var_residuals <- var(resid_vec,
                 na.rm = TRUE)

# Compute R^2
R2_by_hand <- var_fitted / var_response

# Table
tibble(Statistic = c("Var(Response) = Var(avg_internet_users)",
                     "Var(Fitted) = Var(ŷ)",
                     "Var(Residuals)  = Var(y − ŷ)",
                     "R² = B / A"),
       Value = c(var_response, 
                 var_fitted, 
                 var_residuals, 
                 R2_by_hand)) |>
  mutate(Value = round(Value, 3)) |>
  kable(caption = "Variances & R² for the Model",
      col.names = c("Statistic", 
                    "Value"),
      align = c("l", "r")) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                                      "hover", 
                                      "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE,
                font_size = 14) |>
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

The table presents the variances as well the model R². It shows us that the total variability in average internet usage across countries is 298.517, of which 129.507 (about 43.4%) is explained by the linear relationship with average GDP per Capita; the remaining 169.010 represents unexplained variance.

Since R² = 0.434, our model accounts for roughly 43.4% of the variability in average internet usage. This suggests a moderate fit in our model where GDP per Capita explains some of the cross‐country differences in internet adoption.

## Cross Validation

```{r}

library(purrr)

# Create the folds: we will use 5 folds (at least 10 samples per fold)
k <- 5
n <- nrow(avg_data)
fold_assignments <- sample(rep(1:k, length.out = n))

# Define a function to compute R² for a single fold
compute_r2_fold <- function(fold_num) {
  train_data <- avg_data[fold_assignments != fold_num, ]
  val_data   <- avg_data[fold_assignments == fold_num, ]
  
  model_k <- lm(avg_internet_users ~ avg_income, data = train_data)
  predictions <- predict(model_k, newdata = val_data)
  
  ss_res <- sum((val_data$avg_internet_users - predictions)^2)
  ss_tot <- sum((val_data$avg_internet_users - mean(val_data$avg_internet_users))^2)
  
  r2 <- 1 - ss_res / ss_tot
  return(r2)
}

# Compute R² for each fold using map
r2_values <- map_dbl(1:k, compute_r2_fold)

# Create a data frame for plotting
r2_df <- tibble(Fold = 1:k, R2 = r2_values)

# Plot the R² values
ggplot(r2_df, aes(x = factor(Fold), y = R2)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(r2_values), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "R² Values from 5-Fold Cross-Validation",
       x = "Fold",
       y = "Validation R²") +
  theme_minimal()

```
The plot above shows the different R² values from a 5-fold-cross validation where each bar represents the model's performance on a different fold. This is used to see if the model would respond to new data. The red dotted line marks the average R², which is about 0.39. This suggests that our model explains about 39% of the variation in internet usage when applied to new data, which is similar to the training R² of 0.434. This means there is no significant evidence of our model over fitting and we can thus conclude that GDP per Capita is a moderately effective predictor of internet usage. 

## Conclusion
Our analysis reveals a positive relationship between a country’s per person wealth and its internet usage rates, which supports our initial hypothesis that greater individual wealth enable more access to technology. Although the model explains a notable portion of the variation in internet usage (as confirmed by the cross validation) there is still a large amount of the variation that was not explained by our model. This suggests that per person wealth is only one of many factors influencing internet access.
