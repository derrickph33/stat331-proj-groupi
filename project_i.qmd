## Introduction

Using two datasets with records of GDP per Capita and Internet usage rates we plan to find whether the higher a persons income is the more access they can have to technology.

We are examining whether there is a relationship between a country’s GDP per Capita and the percentage of its population using the internet. We got the internet data from Gapminder @Gapminder, which gives the proportion of people in each country that have internet access each year since 1960 and we got our income data from World Bank @World_Bank_Open_Data. This data provides the GDP per Capita of each country year by year. We hypothesize that countries with higher GDP per Capita will also have higher internet usage. We thought that wealthier countries are more likely to have the technological accessibility needed to support widespread internet. We did find outside evidence to support this claim, this author from Pew Research @Author_2014 found that income is a strong predictor of internet use across countries.

## Data Cleaning

Before analysis, we converted any GDP per Capita values into full numeric values. For example, income values like "31.7k" were converted to "31700" to allow for numerical analysis. We applied this conversion to all years for each country, then reshaped the table so that each row corresponds to a single country-year observation. We performed a similar conversion for the Internet usage percentages before merging the two sources together.

```{r}
# Load in all necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
```

```{r}
# Read in the csv files
income_original <- read_csv("income_per_person_long_series.csv")
internet_original <- read_csv("internet_users.csv")
```

```{r}
# Cleaning Income data
# Function to convert 'k' values (e.g., "1.1k") to numeric
convert_k_to_num <- function(x) {
  x <- as.character(x)
  ifelse(
    str_detect(x, "k"),
    as.numeric(str_remove(x, "k")) * 1000,
    as.numeric(x)
  )
}

# Apply conversion to all columns except 'country'
income_clean <- income_original |>
  mutate(across(-country, 
                convert_k_to_num)) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "income") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r}
# Cleaning Internet Data
internet_clean <- internet_original |>
  mutate(across(-country, 
                convert_k_to_num)) |>
  pivot_longer(-country, 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "internet_users") |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r}
# Join the Datasets
combined_data <- income_clean |>
  inner_join(internet_clean, 
             by = c("country", 
                    "year"))
```

## Modeling the Relationship between Average Internet Usage and GDP per Capita

**Data Visualization**

```{r}
# Code for 2.1 Part 1
avg_data <- combined_data |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(avg_income = mean(income, 
                              na.rm = TRUE),
            avg_internet_users = mean(internet_users, 
                                      na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
ggplot(avg_data, 
       aes(x = avg_income, 
           y = avg_internet_users)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,
             color = "darkblue", 
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Average Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "Average GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Average Internet Usage (%)",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot shows each country’s average GDP per Capita on the x‐axis and its average Internet usage rate on the y‐axis. From this plot we can see a positive trend that countries with higher average income also tend to have greater Internet usage.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Code for 2.1 Part 2
animated_plot <- ggplot(combined_data, 
                        aes(x = income, 
                            y = internet_users)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, 
             color = "red", 
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Internet Usage (%)",
       title = "Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita: {round(frame_time)}", 
       subtitle = "Each point is one country in a given year",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal() +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

# 2) Render as a GIF, saved it to an object to try to fix rendering issues
animated_obj <- animate(animated_plot, 
                        fps = 2, 
                        duration = 10,
                        width = 600, 
                        height = 450,
                        renderer = gifski_renderer())

anim_save("income_vs_internet.gif", 
          animation = animated_obj)
```

![](income_vs_internet.gif)

The animated plot shows the change over time for all countries in the dataset. We can infer that over time, the internet usage has increased as the GDP per Capita also increased.

**Linear Regression**

For linear regression, we chose to summarize our data by getting each country’s average GDP per capita and average Internet usage rate across all years. We chose to do this because then every point in the plot is represented by a single country making it straightforward to fit a line through all countries’ averages.

```{r}
# Code for 2.2
# Scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(avg_data, 
       aes(x = avg_income, 
           y = avg_internet_users)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", 
             alpha = 0.7,
             size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales :: comma) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales :: percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Internet Usage vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "Average GDP per Capita (USD)",
       y = "Average Internet Usage (%)",
       caption = "Data Source: Gapminder & World Bank") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Fit linear regression model
model <- lm(avg_internet_users ~ avg_income, 
            data = avg_data)

# Tidy and display coefficients
tidy(model) |>
  mutate(Term = case_when(term == "(Intercept)"  ~ "Intercept",
                          term == "avg_income"   ~ "Avg Income (USD) - Slope"),
         Estimate = round(estimate, 3),
         `Std. Error` = round(std.error, 3),
         `t‐value` = round(statistic, 3),
         `p‐value` = formatC(p.value, 
                             format = "e", 
                             digits = 2)) |>
  select(Term, 
         Estimate, 
         `Std. Error`, 
         `t‐value`, 
         `p‐value`) |>
  kable(caption = "Linear Regression Coefficients: Internet Usage ~ GDP per Capita",
        col.names = c("Term", 
                      "Estimate", 
                      "Std. Error", 
                      "t‐value", 
                      "p‐value"),
        align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r"))
```

From our linear regression model, we can see that $$
\widehat{\text{Internet}} \;=\; 12.683 \;+\; 0.001 \times \text{Income}.
$$\
The intercept (12.683, p = 3.96\times10\^{-21}) represents a baseline Internet usage when Income = 0, and the slope (0.001, p = 1.67\times10\^{-26}) indicates that a \$1 increase in GDP per Capita corresponds to a 0.001 percentage‐point increase in Internet usage.

**Model Fit**

```{r}
# Code for 2.3
# Extract vectors
y_vec <- avg_data$avg_internet_users
y_hat_vec <- fitted(model)
resid_vec <- residuals(model)

# Compute variances
var_response <- var(y_vec,
                    na.rm = TRUE)
var_fitted <- var(y_hat_vec,
                  na.rm = TRUE)
var_residuals <- var(resid_vec,
                 na.rm = TRUE)

# Compute R^2
R2_by_hand <- var_fitted / var_response

# Table
tibble(Statistic = c("Var(Response) = Var(avg_internet_users)",
                     "Var(Fitted) = Var(ŷ)",
                     "Var(Residuals)  = Var(y − ŷ)",
                     "R² = B / A"),
       Value = c(var_response, 
                 var_fitted, 
                 var_residuals, 
                 R2_by_hand)) |>
  mutate(Value = round(Value, 3)) |>
  kable(caption = "Variances & R² for the Model",
      col.names = c("Statistic", 
                    "Value"),
      align = c("l", "r")) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                                      "hover", 
                                      "condensed"),
                full_width = FALSE,
                font_size = 14) |>
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

The table presents the variances as well the model R². It shows us that the total variance in average Internet usage across countries is 298.517, of which 129.507 (about 43.4%) is explained by the linear relationship with average GDP per Capita; the remaining 169.010 represents unexplained variance.

Since R² = 0.434, our model accounts for roughly 43.4% of the variability in average internet usage. This suggests a moderate fit in our model which GDP per Capita explains cross‐country differences in Internet adoption, while additionally over half of the variance remains due to other factors.

## Cross Validation

```{r}

library(purrr)

# Create the folds: we will use 5 folds (at least 10 samples per fold)
k <- 5
n <- nrow(avg_data)
fold_assignments <- sample(rep(1:k, length.out = n))

# Define a function to compute R² for a single fold
compute_r2_fold <- function(fold_num) {
  train_data <- avg_data[fold_assignments != fold_num, ]
  val_data   <- avg_data[fold_assignments == fold_num, ]
  
  model_k <- lm(avg_internet_users ~ avg_income, data = train_data)
  predictions <- predict(model_k, newdata = val_data)
  
  ss_res <- sum((val_data$avg_internet_users - predictions)^2)
  ss_tot <- sum((val_data$avg_internet_users - mean(val_data$avg_internet_users))^2)
  
  r2 <- 1 - ss_res / ss_tot
  return(r2)
}

# Compute R² for each fold using map
r2_values <- map_dbl(1:k, compute_r2_fold)

# Create a data frame for plotting
r2_df <- tibble(Fold = 1:k, R2 = r2_values)

# Plot the R² values
ggplot(r2_df, aes(x = factor(Fold), y = R2)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(r2_values), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "R² Values from 5-Fold Cross-Validation",
       x = "Fold",
       y = "Validation R²") +
  theme_minimal()

```
The plot shows the different R² values from the 5-fold-cross validation where each bar represents the model's performance on a different fold. The red dotted line marks the average R², which is about 0.39. This suggests that our model explains about 39% of the variation in internet usage when applied to new data. This is similar to the training R² of 0.434 meaning there is no significant evidence of over fitting. Even though performance varies between the folds, the results demonstrate that GDP per Capita is a decently effective predictor of internet usage.
